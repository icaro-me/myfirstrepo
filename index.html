    <body> <h1>my first personal blog, ok?</h1><br><a href="loggin_page.html" target="_blank"><button>Login</button></a>
    <p>Ok, here we go! Hi guys, my name is Hicaro and this is my first website (or at least the first one I've decided to launch to the public). Well, leaving this on side, in this blog I intend to pass myself off as a super famous Hollywood actor from the 90s or better, of course that wouldn't go down well. So first of all, some people who are curious about my profile must be asking themselves "why did I write all this in English instead of using my native language?" This is indeed strange, but we can agree that it gives the website a mysterious tone hahahaha (oh and sorry for the big mistakes, I'm not fluent in English yet;{ )</p>
        <br><h2>one fabulous actor</h2><br>
        <p>As you can see, this is not a betting site or an advertisement for my pre-sale of beauty courses, lol. In fact, as a super famous actor, I'm going to tell and show you some of my exploits as a "software maker" here. In case anyone hasn't noticed yet, I really do well with current machines and computer engineering, so feel free to ask me more questions later.</p>
        <h1>my games and my youtube channel</h1><br>
        <h2>always the same or drab...</h2>
        <p>drab or monotonous, as my chemistry teacher used to say, it's not Spider-Man but it's amazing, the game is exactly what the name says, all the same, similar in case you haven't noticed, it's about a cube that is trapped in a maze (your BIGGEST PREDATOR ENEMY is just a bigger cube) ok I failed a little in this part, but in the same way the game was created in a perhaps little known engine "Godot" and okay? but where are the great feats? so, well, how can I explain it? in the mobile version I actually used a mobile engine, that is, creating a mobile game, using a mobile phone! Awesome, right?? so what makes it even cooler is that I used something similar to what nuclear scientists call a "hydrogen bomb" which in fact CLEARLY refers to my cell phoneðŸ˜žâœŒ</p>

        <p>As a super generous and honest man, I'm going to leave a button below with a link full of viruses and malwares for your cell phone! ah it's just a video about my game. But how can I download the game? In fact, no one other than me will be able to play it because I'm a super selfish man and I don't care about you. Well, as you can see, we're going through an economic crisis in our country and that ends up complicating everything. With the unhealthy price of the American dollar (something like 6.30 Brazilian real), it became very expensive and not very profitable for me to publish the game, since I won't get my money back. So I ended up preferring to leave this option aside, but obviously, like anyone else, I like to show off my achievements.</p>

        <h2>Another attempt with same fail</h2>
        <p>ok, as we can see it wasn't just an attempt, even more than these 2, in fact I don't even know how to report it since I couldn't even give a name to this "masterpiece", also made using a mobile gamemaker engine that actually Its version was ported from Windows to mobile, well the game is an experimental test of the engine since compared to the others it was able to maintain high performance and thus made its use more favorable. Because I didn't have a goal in the game, I ended up putting the project aside while I appreciated the beauty of the 2D models I used.</p><br>

        <P>As a man with a good heart and a lot of effort, I ended up being kind enough to provide the link to download the assets (in fact, the shitty public license forced me to put it here, but let's see on the funny side, I'm great with sarcasm, right?)<a href="https://maaot.itch.io/mossy-cavern" target="_blank">click here</a> for those of you who didn't click, feel lucky, because in fact it was just a link with a bunch of viruses and slow software. Well, leaving that aside, I would also like to talk about how terrible the experience with mobile engines was and how complex it becomes to do simple things if all you have in your hands is an old cell phone with several bugs.</p>
        
        
        <h2>About the creation of this website</h2>
        <p>a little about this site, I created it using only the most common and simple programming languages â€‹â€‹(html, css, javascript and json, ok maybe I used a little xml) although it seems like a lot this is my first time using bank languages of data such as xml and json which were actually extremely difficult to learn since all the programming logic that I knew was gone, which is why the login page is not yet active.</p>
